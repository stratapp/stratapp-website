## Stride’s Big Idea

Without structure, social collaboration can quickly become a firehose of noise and distraction.

To help solve this, Atlassian thought of a clever idea to add structure to social. When you posted something in Stride by Atlassian, you could tag the post as a:

* Comment
* Question
* Action

Think about that for a moment. Not only are you making life easier for your recipients, it enables you to go back to filter on your own posts. For example, “what was that question I asked Tom last week?”

Stride also added some new innovations around profile status. Stride encouraged users to take “zone time” to think, research, be creative and get high-value work done. How’s that, a social app making it easier for you to avoid getting caught in the productivity killer trap of always being livechat accessible to your boss and colleagues? Admirable!

## #slack Buries Stride

Stride was released in Sep 2017. After only 9 months, Stride was acquired by #slack in Jul 2018.

Not long after that, #slack filed for their IPO on the US stock exchange in Apr 2019.

There was a ground swell of excitement globally on Atlassian’s innovation to add structure to social. That was probably not great timing for #slack, leading up to their IPO.

After acquiring Stride, #slack buried it. Goneski! \[apologies for the Australian / New Zealand slang\]

## #stratapp Goes Next Level

We ran workshops on this social-with-structure idea with business owners, CEOs, executives, mid-level managers, team leaders and frontline employees.

We concluded 3 things:

1. 10 tags will cover about 90% of scenarios
2. We should add the ability to post or request
3. The same structure could apply to all card types and workboards, not only social messaging and groups

### Social Post

Here are the 10 tags inside a #stratapp social post:

### Social Request

Here are the 3 tags inside a #stratapp social request:

### Filters

\#stratapp has powerful filters for all users across the whole app, not only on social messaging and groups.

For example, imagine being able to find out the following 3 things in less than 5 seconds:

_Example #1_

_I’ve been away for 72hrs. What strategy related questions have been asked, and what decisions or approvals have been made, whilst I was away? Great, now let’s narrow that down further to the strategy aspects I own or am involved in._

_Example #2_

_For the risks, ideas and challenges I currently own, what is the status of tasks I have assigned to others?_

_Example #3_

_Who is having the most influence on strategy or KPI related work? Who are the emerging team players on KPIs? Who are the emerging innovators on strategy?_

### Zone Time

Let’s not forget that other Atlassian innovation in Stride regards the user’s profile status (described as “zone time” in the opening paragraphs above).

\#stratapp has expanded further on that innovation:

## Whiteboard Video

Here’s me on a whiteboard explaining [how and why we applied structure to social]().

Startup tech founders don’t tend to do this, but you’ll see in that video, just like in this article, I give full credit to the original thinking and innovation from the talented folks at Atlassian.

\#stratapp is a consulting goldmine.

# Why?

If you know what's going on, at all levels in the client's organization, you can add more value.  Not only that, the client's CEO and leadership team have a tangible context for accepting your proposals.

## Consulting Sales Today

Historically consulting sales are highly dependent on interpreting what's going on via personal relationships with a few key stakeholders.  Through this subjective lens over time consuming lunches, dinners and workshops, consultants try to interpret _the problem_, before scoping out potential ways to help.

* Visibility is subjective, and limited to these key relationships
* Deliverables are point-in-time static documents
* Consultants get partly blamed for poor execution by the client 
* Onselling additional work takes lots of time, energy and luck

## Consulting Sales Future

\#stratapp changes the game on how consulting work gets identified, sold and delivered.

How?  #stratapp provides more data and insights than any other tech.  

* See everything, at all levels in real time
* Deliver work in a way that is alive and interactive
* Derisk your work, by proactively assisting on blockers
* Onsell with data, genuine insights and aligned interests

Of course, what the consultant can see and edit is controlled by the client.

### Genuine Insights

Imagine if you could see in just a few seconds the status of the client's:

* strategy execution across goals/objectives/actions/projects
* KPIs/OKRs
* risks/mitigations/assumptions
* projects/tasks
* challenges/ideas
* meetings
* sentiment and engagement
* team players
* innovators
* interactive global heatmap showing what's hot right now

Imagine if you can filter that data by unlimited combinations of geography, levels, functions, verticals and horizontals.

This level of real time alignment and insight is unprecedented - giving progressive leaders, employees and consultants unlimited opportunities to innovate strategy execution and day to day work.

### Consulting Deliverables (no more static docs)

Old school consulting deliverables, in the form of static documents, are time consuming, hugely unproductive, 'top down' by nature and fast out of date.

One-off project management software doesn't help either - being expensive, complex to use and understandable to less than 5% of employees.

Consultants and the clients need a collaboration environment that achieves the following:

* Agile - alive and interactive, evolving as the execution provides more insights
* Inclusive - a user experience and price that achieves org-wide engagement
* Easy - naturally intuitive, making the time to value of minutes, not weeks
* Lasting - adds value to the client beyond the life of the consulting engagement
* Efficient - allows CTOs to eliminate single-purpose-apps and integrations
* Dual - helps every employee execute both strategic and day to day work

\#stratapp is a consulting goldmine.

# Why?

If you know what's going on, at all levels in the client's organization, you can add more value.  Not only that, the client's CEO and leadership team have a tangible context for accepting your proposals.

## Consulting Sales Today

Historically consulting sales are highly dependent on interpreting what's going on via personal relationships with a few key stakeholders.  Through this (often) subjective lens over lunches, dinners and workshops, consultants try to interpret _the problem_, before scoping out potential ways to help.

* Visibility is subjective, and limited to these key relationships
* Deliverables are point-in-time static documents
* Consultants get blamed for poor client execution
* On-selling more work takes lots of time, energy and some luck

## Consulting Sales Future

\#stratapp changes the game on how consulting work gets sold and delivered.

\#stratapp provides more data and insights than any other tech.

* See everything, at all levels in real time
* Deliver work in a way that is alive and interactive
* Derisk your work, by proactively assisting on blockers
* On-sell with data, genuine insights and aligned interests

### Genuine Insights

Imagine if you could see in just a few seconds the status of the client's:

* strategy execution across goals/objectives/actions/projects
* KPIs/OKRs
* risks/mitigations/assumptions
* projects/tasks
* challenges/ideas
* meetings
* sentiment and engagement
* team players
* innovators
* what's hot and trending right now (conversations or work)

Imagine if you can filter that data by unlimited combinations of geography, levels, functions, verticals and horizontals.

This level of real time data and insight is unprecedented.

### Consulting Deliverables (no more static docs)

The old school way of handing over consulting deliverables in the form of static documents, is time consuming, unproductive and creates a burden for both the consultant and the client.  One-off project management software doesn't help either.

Consultants and the clients need a collaboration environment that achieves the following:

* Agile - alive and interactive, evolving as execution provides more insights
* Org-wide - a user experience and price that achieves org-wide engagement
* Easy - naturally intuitive, providing a time to value of minutes, not weeks
* Lasting - adds value to the client beyond the life of the consulting engagement
* Efficient - allows CTOs to consolidate/eliminate single-purpose-apps
* Dual - helps employees execute both strategic and day to day work

\#stratapp is a consulting goldmine.

# How?

If you know what's going on, at all levels in the client's organization, you can add more value to the client.  Not only that, the client CEO and leadership team have a tangible context and rationale for accepting your proposals.

# Consulting Sales Today

Historically consulting sales are highly dependent on interpreting what's going on via personal relationships with a few key stakeholders.  Over lunches, dinners and workshops we try to interpret _the problem_, before scoping out potential ways to help.

* Visibility is subjective, and limited to these key relationships
* Deliverables are point-in-time static documents
* Consultants sometimes get blamed for poor client execution
* On-selling more work takes lots of time, energy and some luck

# Consulting Sales Future

\#stratapp changes the game on how consulting work gets sold and delivered.

\#stratapp provides more data and insights than any other tech.

* See everything, at all levels in real time
* Deliver work in a way that is alive and interactive
* Derisk your work, by proactively assisting on blockers
* On-sell with data, genuine insights and aligned interests

## Genuine Insights

Imagine if you could see in just a few seconds the status of:

* strategic goals/objectives/actions/projects
* KPIs/OKRs
* risks/mitigations/assumptions
* projects/tasks
* challenges/ideas
* sentiment and engagement by geography/function/vertical/horizontal
* team players
* innovators
* what's hot and trending right now (conversations or work)

This level of real time data and insight is unprecedented.

## Deliverables (no more static docs)

Handing over consulting deliverables in the form of static documents creates a burden for both the consultant and the client.

One-off project management software doesn't help either.

Both the consultant and the client need a tech environment that achieves the following:

* Agile -
* Interactive
* Org-wide
* Affordable
* Easy
* Lasting
* Dual -

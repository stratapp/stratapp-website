\#stratapp is a consulting goldmine.

# How?

If you know exactly what's going on, at all levels in the client's organization, you can add more value to the client.  Not only that, the client CEO and leadership team have a tangible context and rationale for accepting your proposals.

# Old School Consulting Sales

Historically consulting sales are highly dependent on interpreting what's going on via personal relationships with a few key stakeholders.  Over lunches, dinners and workshops we try to interpret _the problem_, before scoping out potential ways to help.

* Visibility is subjective, and limited to these key relationships
* Deliverables are point-in-time static documents
* Consultants sometimes get blamed for poor client execution
* On-selling more work takes lots of time, energy and some luck

# Future Consulting

\#stratapp changes the game on how consulting work gets sold and delivered.

\#stratapp provides more data and insights than any other tech.

* See everything, at all levels in real time
* Deliver work in a way that is alive and interactive
* Derisk your work, by proactively assisting on blockers
* On-sell with data, genuine insights and aligned interests

## Genuine Insights

Imagine if you could see in just a few seconds the status of:

* strategic goals/objectives/actions/projects
* KPIs/OKRs
* risks/mitigations/assumptions
* projects/tasks
* challenges/ideas
* sentiment and engagement by geography/function/vertical/horizontal
* team players
* innovators
* what's hot and trending right now (conversations or work)

This level of real time data and insight is unprecedented.

## Deliverables - No More Static Docs

Handing over consulting deliverables in the form of static documents creates a burden for both the consultant and the client.

One-off project management software doesn't help either.

Both the consultant and the client need a tech environment that achieves the following:

* Agile -
* Interactive
* Org-wide
* Affordable
* Easy
* Lasting
* Dual -

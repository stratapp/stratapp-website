Ray Dalio champions the principle of embracing thoughtful disagreement. The ability to exchange controversial ideas without causing problems.

His solution is to consciously ask each other in the workplace:

* How am I going to be with you? How should you be with me?
* Is it okay for me to be honest with you, that is, me telling you what I really think?
* Are you okay being honest with me?

Mr Dalio argues: “In order to be successful, we have to have independent thinkers — so independent that they’ll bet against the consensus." And to do that, “You have to put your honest thoughts on the table.” Then, the best ideas rise to the top.

## Millennials and Radical Transparency

Millennials have their own take on the value of radical transparency - as consumers, and as employees.

### Millennial Consumers

Millennials as consumers are demanding greater transparency through the supply chain. Recent surveys suggest millennial consumer behaviour as:

* 42% researching where and how goods are made, including the source products that go into them
* 66% willing to pay more for sustainable goods
* 50% considering the resale value of new items before purchase

\[sources: [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2019/05/29/3-ways-millennials-and-gen-z-consumers-are-radically-transforming-the-luxury-market/#a8663ac479fd "Forbes"); [BoF](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/intelligence/the-year-ahead-the-case-for-radical-transparency "BoF"); [CSR Wire](https://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/42057-Are-You-Ready-for-the-Honest-Generation- "CSR Wire")\]

This behaviour is driving value-chain innovation, including tracking from farm/ocean-to-plate on food, from field-to-outlet on textiles, and from consumer-to-recycled for almost every consumer product.

### Millennial Employees

Millennials as employees are rewriting the social contract at work.

Their thinking brings a fresh new perspective to the relationship between employer and employee:

_If you want me to be committed to my role and this company, show me the same. Let us see what you are doing as the owner/CEO/executive/leader/boss to take this company forward. Show me you are truly committed to our success and that you genuinely represent the company’s values. Do that, and I’ll show you the same as your employee._

### The CEO Dilemma

This is a big shift in employee thinking. The wave is imminent, because by 2025, 75% of the workforce will comprise millennials.

Top-down leadership and control does not motivate millennials. I’d argue it didn’t really motivate X-Gen either, but they towed the line, stayed with their employer for 3+ years and got their work done.

Progressive leaders, including X-Gen and Baby Boomers, are ready to embrace org-wide engagement and radical transparency. Not just to please millennials. Progressive leaders have already seen first hand the power of social and work collaboration in small teams - usually the product, digital marketing and tech teams in their companies.

## Achieving Radical Transparency

The question is, how to make that powerful collaboration experience org-wide, so that radical transparency becomes a natural part of company culture.

Social and work collaboration tools (#slack, yammer, teams, trello, asana, etc) have been a huge step forward since 2009. But these apps lack structure, an org-wide UX and a strategic context, and this creates two problems:

1. Risk of dding more distractions and noise
2. Lack of adoption by executives and senior managers ... bottom up, whilst positive, is just not enough if the decision makers vacate

There is no doubt collaboration tech beats email and the old ways of getting work done. The problem is, the current suite of apps have been designed for small teams of 5 to 30 people. Turn them on for hundreds or thousands of employees and the risk is chaos.

### Imagine the Future

To achieve radical transparency at work, companies need collaboration tech that has been designed from the outset as an org-wide experience - tech that adds value to every employee, every day, across all levels, roles and generations.

To add value every day means helping employees with their day to day work, as well as the overall strategic context and corresponding initiatives.

A seamless org-wide experience also means fresh thinking on features such as:

* Org-design attributes (e.g. @F/sales + @G/APAC) to easily invite people to strategic initiatives, projects, meetings, ideas, challenges, risks, messages, cards and workboards
* Powerful filters and social-with-structure, so people can quickly see exactly what they need to
* Easy to understand security levels, so that radical transparency doesn’t become radically out of control
* Intuitive user experiences, so people of all tech aptitudes don’t need to be trained on how to use it

Imagine if org-wide collaboration could sit within an easy to understand strategic context - why is our organization here (a la Simon Sinek), what are we trying to achieve (a la Prof Roger Martin), how are we going to get there (cascading strategy tree) and how are we going right now (live data and collaboration, at every level in the strategy tree)?

This would allow every employee to embrace and contribute to what their CEO, executives and managers are trying to achieve. This radical transparency delivers on the new social contract being created by our millennials:

_First show me you are committed, then you’ll see my commitment!_

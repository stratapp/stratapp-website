seo_title: Live meeting notes, that automatically consolidate your tasks across all
  meetings
seo_description: How many meetings and calls do you do each day?  Imagine if all participants
  were on the same (digital) page - live editing together, sharing ideas within structured
  social, adding files and links and capturing actions.  Doing all of this within
  the same UX, without having to open another "single use app".

    We are experienced SaaS founders with a compelling vision. Backed by industry leaders who are serious about achieving and utilising the full potential of their current and future workforce.

    Leadership is essential when achieving a 10x impact client side. With that in mind, we’d like to personally invite you to a first call with one of our founders.

    As #stratapp scales, our commitment to that initial dialogue will remain at our core - We will continue to make direct CEO/CXO to founder communication a priority by joining the back end of first calls and follow up sessions for leadership teams.

    you with a client portal to access your subscription status, payment methods,
    billing information, payment history and invoices.
- question: Do you offer implementation support?
  answer: |-
    Yes, we have partnered with [Coherent Strategy](http://coherentstrat.com/ "Coherent Strategy") to coach and support our clients on implementation.

    As far as we know, we are the world's first B2B SaaS company to design the implementation methodology for our partners AND we have prescribed reasonable cost budgets for each and every step.

    Why? We genuinely care about our clientsâ€™ success, and that includes removing the stress, hassle and unforseen costs of implementation.
- question: Is our data safe?
  answer: |-
    Yes, we use the latest in data encryption and authentication technology.

    \#stratapp supports SAML.

    \#stratapp is built on Microservices on top of Microsoft Service Fabric, hosted on Microsoft Azure.
- question: 'What happens when I stop using #stratapp?'
  answer: |-
    No problem, there are no termination fees.

    In future releases we will be adding APIs for you to link your data to BI tools.

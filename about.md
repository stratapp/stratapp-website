  ### we are experienced SaaS founders, with a 10 year vision backed by investors who are market leaders

  For 30 years strategy formation, documentation, communication and execution has been flawed. The age old paradigms of static documents and top down control are holding us back. It is a global problem, affecting most organizations regardless of size, sector, culture or country.

  It is time we fixed this.

  We embraced the progressive thinking in social and work collaboration tech of the last 11 years, to create a seamless experience for executing both strategy and day-to-day work, in one place.

  We did not invent new management buzz words, theory or methods. We carefully designed #stratapp around what you already know.

  Therefore, your time-to-value on #stratapp is days - not months, quarters or years.

  ### we are rethinking SaaS playbooks on time-to-value

  B2B SaaS companies typically lock their clients into a prepaid contract, then leave the clients to figure out implementation by themselves; putting forward a list of 'preferred partners' who offer different advice, methodologies, resources and pricing.

  In contrast, we have actually designed the implementation methodology for our partners AND we have prescribed reasonable cost budgets for each and every step.

  Why?  We genuinely care about our clients' success, and that includes removing the stress, hassle and unforseen costs of implementation.

  Your time-to-value on #stratapp is days - not months, quarters or years.

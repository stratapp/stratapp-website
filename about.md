intro_text: "{:.text-danger}\n{:.font-weight-bold}\n\n### we are experienced SaaS
  founders, with a compelling vision, backed by investors who are market leaders across
  several industries\n\nFor 30 years the process of strategy formation, documentation,
  communication and execution has been fundamentally flawed. The age old paradigms
  of static documents and top down control have been holding all of us all back.  It
  is a global problem, affecting most organizations regardless of size, sector or
  geography.\n\nIt is time to fix this. We've embraced the most progressive thinking
  in work and social collaboration of the last 10 years, and applied those to create
  a seamless org-wide experience for executing both strategy and day-to-day work.\n\nWe've
  done this without inventing new management terms or methods. #stratapp is designed
  around what executives, managers and team leaders already know. \n\nTherefore, we
  make your time to value days, not months or years."

  ### we are rethinking the B2B SaaS playbook, breaking the tradition of avoiding implementation

  B2B SaaS companies typically lock their clients into a prepaid contract, then leave the client to figure out the implementation by themselves, putting forward a list of 'preferred partners' offering different advice, methodologies, resources and pricing.

  We are rewriting the SaaS playbook. We have developed the methodology for our partners, and we have laid out the expected cost ranges for each step.

  Why? We genuinely care about our clients' success, and we have decided that should include removing stress, hassle and unforseen costs on implementation.

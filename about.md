  ### we are experienced SaaS founders, with a compelling vision backed by investors who are market leaders

  For 30 years the process of strategy formation, documentation, communication and execution has been fundamentally flawed. The age old paradigms of static documents and top down control are holding all of us back.  It is a global problem, affecting most organizations regardless of size, sector, culture or geography.

  It is time to fix this. We have embraced the most progressive thinking in work and social collaboration tech of the last 10 years, and created a seamless experience for executing both strategy and day-to-day work in one place.

  We haven't invented new management buzz words or proprietory methods. #stratapp is designed around what CEOs, executives, managers and team leaders already know.

  Therefore, we make your time-to-value days, not months or years.

  ### we are rethinking SaaS playbooks on time-to-value

  B2B SaaS companies typically lock their clients into a prepaid contract, then leave the client to figure out the implementation by themselves; putting forward a list of 'preferred partners' offering different advice, methodologies, resources and pricing.

  We are rethinking the SaaS playbook. We have designed the methodology for our partners AND we have prescribed reasonable cost budgets for each and every step.

  Why? We genuinely care about our clients' success, and that includes removing the stress, hassle and unforseen costs of implementation.

  Your time-to-value on #stratapp is days, not months or years.

  ### we are experienced SaaS founders, with a compelling vision backed by investors who are market leaders

  For 30 years the process of strategy formation, documentation, communication and execution has been fundamentally flawed. The age old paradigms of static documents and top down control are holding all of us all back.  It is a global problem, affecting most organizations regardless of size, sector, culture or geography.

  It is time to fix this. We've embraced the most progressive thinking in work and social collaboration of the last 10 years, and applied those to create a seamless org-wide experience for executing both strategy and day-to-day work.

  We've done this without inventing new management terms or methods. #stratapp is designed around what executives, managers and team leaders already know.

  Therefore, we make your time to value days, not months or years.

  ### we are rethinking the B2B SaaS playbook on the client's time-to-value

  B2B SaaS companies typically lock their clients into a prepaid contract, then leave the client to figure out the implementation by themselves; putting forward a list of 'preferred partners' offering different advice, methodologies, resources and pricing.

  We are rethinking the SaaS playbook. We have designed the methodology for our partners AND we have prescribed reasonable cost budgets for each and every step.

  Why? We genuinely care about our clients' success, and that includes removing the stress, hassle and unforseen costs of implementation.

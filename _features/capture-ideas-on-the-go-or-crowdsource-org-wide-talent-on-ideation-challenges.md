When do the best ideas hit us?  Certainly not during quarterly or annual surveys! 

Ideas live and breathe with us everyday.  It be during an internal or external meeting, commute to work, inflight or when our kids come up with a new way of doing things.

Capture ideas on the go, inside #stratapp.  Engage others to contribute to or review your ideas.  Add your ideas to other cards and workboards inside #stratapp.

Or, you can frame a challenge and select who you want to participate.  Articulate a problem or opportunity you are trying to solve, and then crowdsource ideas from others to help solve it.

Ideation is powerful, and once again with #stratapp you donâ€™t need to be sending your employees to yet another app.  Ideas and Challenges are seamless features inside #stratapp, that anyone can use to help drive performance on both strategy and day to day work.

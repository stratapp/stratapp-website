The strategic planning tree cascades as:

{:.text-primary}
{:.font-weight-bold}
#### Overviewgoals > objectives > actions > projects

At each level in the tree you can assign different owners, teams, workboards, tasks and KPIs. You can quickly catch up strategy execution via the dashboard, trending and social views. What people have access to see and interact with is subject to 4x security levels.

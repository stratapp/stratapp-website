The strategic planning tree cascades as: goals > objectives > actions > projects. At each level in the tree you can assign different owners, teams, workboards, tasks and KPIs.

You can quickly catch up on strategy execution via the dashboard, trending and social views. What people can see and interact with is subject to 4x security levels.

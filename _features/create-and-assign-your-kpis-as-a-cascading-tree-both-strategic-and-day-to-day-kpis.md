KPIs can be strategic or day to day, quantitative or qualitative.  KPIs can be viewed as their own hierarchical tree (which automatically overlay onto a Live Org Chart), indented list or balanced scorecard.

Most importantly, KPIs can be applied to any module inside #stratapp.  That is, you do not have to adjust or change how your organization manages performance today.

If you walk into your company canteen or lunch area today and ask:

“Please raise your hand if within 1-click on your mobile you can show me your personal KPIs, how they are tracking and where they fit in with the organization overall.”  

How many hands in your organization would go up?  With #stratapp, every employee can.

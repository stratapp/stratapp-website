Ricardo Semler shot to fame with his book Maverick, which cut to the core of empowering employees, whilst pragmatically addressing human constraints and positive attributes in a fresh way, when undertaking org design.

\#stratapp’s real-time transparency and collaboration, across the whole organization, provides an easy and compelling way to engage talent at all levels like never before.

If you decide to combine #stratapp’s world first capability in strategy+execution+collaboration with the progressive lateral thinking of Ricardo Semler, we would love to hear from you!

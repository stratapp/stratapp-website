## Strategy planning software that connects people to goals & closes the strategy-to-execution gap.

“According to a global survey of 700 executives across a variety of industries, conducted by the strategy consulting division of PwC, only 8% of company leaders were said to excel at both strategy and execution.”

“...a bold vision needs to include both a very ambitious destination and a well-conceived path for execution that will get you there.“

“Leaders who master both strategy and execution start by building a bold but executable strategy. Next, they ensure that the company is investing behind the change. And last, they make sure the entire organization is motivated to go the journey.”

This is exactly why #stratapp is not a strategy-only application.

\#stratapp enables all leaders, regardless of their underlying skill orientation, to deliver on both strategy and execution.

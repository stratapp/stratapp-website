Radical transparency has been made famous by Ray Dalio's book Principles.  He champions the principle of embracing thoughtful disagreement. The ability to exchange controversial ideas without causing problems.

To achieve radical transparency at work, companies need collaboration tech that has been designed from the outset as an org-wide experience. To add value every day means helping employees with their day to day work, as well as the overall strategic context and corresponding initiatives.

Imagine if org-wide collaboration could sit within an easy to understand strategic context:

* why is our organization here (a la Simon Sinek)?
* what are we trying to achieve (a la Prof Roger Martin)?
* how are we going to get there (cascading strategy tree)?
* how are we going right now (live data and collaboration at every level in the strategy tree)?

This would allow every employee to embrace and contribute to what their CEO, executives and managers are trying to achieve.

Radical transparency delivers on the new social contract being created by our millennials: _first show me you are committed, then youâ€™ll see my commitment._

Coherent Strategy apply the Gallup Q12 Index to measure employee engagement over time.

The Gallup Q12 Index is derived from 30 years of in-depth behavioral and economic research involving 17 million employees. Gallup has identified 12 core questions - the Q12 - that have emerged to best predict employee and business performance:

Do you know what is expected of you at work?

 1. Do you have the materials and equipment to do your work right?
 2. At work, do you have the opportunity to do what you do best every day?
 3. In the last seven days, have you received recognition or praise for doing good work?
 4. Does your supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about you as a person?
 5. Is there someone at work who encourages your development?
 6. At work, do your opinions seem to count?
 7. Does the mission/purpose of your company make you feel your job is important?
 8. Are your associates (fellow employees) committed to doing quality work?
 9. Do you have a best friend at work?
10. In the last six months, has someone at work talked to you about your progress?
11. In the last year, have you had opportunities to learn and grow?

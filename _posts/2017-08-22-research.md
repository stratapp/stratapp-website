In our view, this is the all time greatest thinking and resource for developing and executing strategy.

As Chuck Harrington, CEO of Parsons Corporation, says: “Richard Rumelt reinforces that a strategy is not a goal or objectives.

\#stratapp provides real time, line-of-sight transparency through: strategy > KPIs > people > work

… powering org-wide engagement and alignment.
